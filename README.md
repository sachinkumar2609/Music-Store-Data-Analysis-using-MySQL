# Music-Store-Data-Analysis-using-MySQL
music store database is a database of 11 tables with huge record intricately connected to each other.
my work encompassed various queries and data analyses using SQL on a music sales database. I determined the senior-most employee by job title, identified countries with the most invoices, and found the top three invoice values. I located the city with the highest total invoice sum for a promotional Music Festival and identified the best-spending customer. Additionally, I queried and ordered email, first name, last name, and genre for Rock music listeners, found the top 10 rock bands based on their track counts, and listed track names longer than the average length. In the advanced section, I calculated customer spending on artists, determined the most popular music genre in each country, and found the highest-spending customer in each country.
